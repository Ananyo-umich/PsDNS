Pseudo-Spectral Fluid Dynamics in Python
========================================

This package contains some simple tools for writing fluid-dynamics solvers using pseudo-spectral methods.  The basic structure of the package is closely patterned on the spectral DNS code of Mortensen and Langtangen, which can be found `here <https://github.com/spectralDNS/spectralDNS>`_ and is described `here <http://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.03638v1.pdf>`_.  That package requires a substantial software stack, and is built on a generic spectral Galerkin package, which makes it more difficult to tinker with.  This package is designed to be a transparent and easy to modify as possible, for use as a research code.
